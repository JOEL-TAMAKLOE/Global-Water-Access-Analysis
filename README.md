## Dataset Overview
### Key Metrics:
- Total global population without safe water: **2.2 billion**
- Urban populations with basic water access: **97.6% (max)** vs **37.2% (min)**
- Rural populations using surface water: **40.5% (max)**
- Income group correlation:
  - High-income countries: **99.9%** basic access
  - Low-income countries: **46.9%** basic access

### Sheets:
1. **Estimates-on-the-use-of-water-(**
   - Contains country-level data for 214 regions
   - Key metrics:
     - Population statistics (urban/rural)
     - Water access types: 
       - Basic services (`wat_bas`)
       - Limited services (`wat_lim`)
       - Unimproved sources (`wat_unimp`)
       - Surface water (`wat_sur`)
     - Income group classifications

2. **Global 2020 report**
   - Aggregated statistics with formulas calculating:
     - Global population coverage
     - Water access metrics (max, min, mean, median)
     - Comparative analysis between urban/rural populations
     - Statistical measures (standard deviation, quartiles)
